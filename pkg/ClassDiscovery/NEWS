		CHANGES IN R VERSION 3.3.13

BUG FIXES

    o	Not exactly sure if this qualifies as a bug fix: modified one
    	of the man pages to remove an unnecessary cross-reference to a
    	package that might not be available.


		CHANGES IN R VERSION 3.3.10

BUG FIXES

    o	Not exactly sure if this qualifies as a bug fix: modified some
        of the test scripts so that they don't raise errors (because
        of not matching the output) on a few of the extra installations
        tested by CRAN. The underlying issue appears to be in the
        results of "hclust", which finds the same groups but assigns
        them different cluster-labels on some machines.

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 3.3.8

UPDATES

    o	Modified use of S4 classes to avoid deprecated and discouraged elements.

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 3.3.0

    o	Added S4 methods "identify" and "text" for the SamplePCA class.

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 3.2.0

BREAKING CHANGES

    o	Finished creating a separate package for the bimodalIndex
    	function, and so removed duplicate code from here.

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 3.1.0

BREAKING CHANGES

    o	Refactored to move the lungData set out of this package into 
    	the newly organized "oompaData" package. 

ADMINISTRATIVE

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 3.0.1

GENERAL

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 3.0.0

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.14.1

BUG FIXES

    o	Moved the previously added .Rout.save files to correct directory.

        samples in group 1 rather than proportion in larger group.

    o	Moved redgreen, jetColors, etc. into the oompaBase package.

BUG FIXES

    o	Fixed labeling error in 'bimodalIndex' function.

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.9.0

    o	Added support for computing the "bimodalIndex" as 
    	defined by Wang et al.  in Cancer Informatics.

        the package in order to provide meaningful examples for the
        computation of the bimodality index.

    o   Added support for namespaces.
