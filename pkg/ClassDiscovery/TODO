[1] Sort out the potential changes to the bimodalIndex code, where we
considered (a) automating the selection of various models or (b)
substituting a different package to fit the EM algorithm currently
provided by mclust.

[2] Write another vignette to go along with the bimodal index code. --
Isn't it time to actually finish this? Or at least start it? Should we
move this to another package?

[3] When R-Forger gets the build process fixed so it finds "Suggests"
packages locally, move 'ProstateData' back from Depends to Suggests.
And get rid of the "import" directive in NAMESPACE.
