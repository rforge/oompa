                CHANGES IN R VERSION 3.0.3

GENERAL

    o	Added a 'show' method that is basically the same as
        'print'. Updated test scripts accordingly. 

                CHANGES IN R VERSION 3.0.1

GENERAL

    o	Moved to R-Forge.


BUG FIXES

    o	Made compatible with new R check steps that verify DESCRIPTION
        and NAMESPACE dependencies.


                CHANGES IN R VERSION 3.0.0


OLD FEATURES

    o   Moved several generic functions (that promoted S3 generics)
    	from this package into the oompaBase package.  Since
    	PreProcess still depends on oompaBase, no functionality should
    	change.

    o   Moved ColorCoding and ColorCodedPair classes from this package
    	into the oompaBase package.  Since PreProcess still depends on
    	oompaBase, no functionality should change.

BREAKING CHANGES

    o	Also moved semantic color names from PreProcess to oompaBase,
        and restructured it to add fewer entries into the namespace.
        Instead of using 'COLOR.EXPECTED', you must now refer to
        'oompaColors$EXPECTED'.


                CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.12.2


BUG FIXES

    o   Lots of documentation updates.


                CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.12.1


BUG FIXES

    o   Corrected export of 'channelize' method.


		CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.10.0

NEW FEATURES

    o	Removed the deprecated function 'stdize'. Use 'scale'
        instead.


		CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.9.0

NEW FEATURES

    o	Added support for namespaces

    o	Deprecated the 'stdize' function in favor of 'scale'. (This
        function was leftover from an early S-Plus version of the
        library.)
