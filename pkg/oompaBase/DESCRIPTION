Description: This package defines the class unions that must be
  preloaded in order for the basic tools in the OOMPA (object-oriented 
  microarray and proteomics analysis) project to be defined and loaded.
  It also includes vectorized operations for row-by-row means,
  variances, and t-tests. Finally, it provides new color schemes.
