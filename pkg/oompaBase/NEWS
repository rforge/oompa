		CHANGES IN R VERSION 3.2.5

NEW FEATURES

    o	Added the 'cyanyellow' color scheme. This scheme is designed
    to provide a divergent palette with distinguishable colors at both
    ends of the scale even for indiviudals whose vision has color
    deficits (that is, they lack cone receptors for one of the primary
    colors).


		CHANGES IN R VERSION 3.2.0

NEW FEATURES

    o	Added the 'grayscale' color scheme.

BUG FIXES

    o	Made compatible with new R check steps that verify DESCRIPTION
        and NAMESPACE dependencies.

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 3.1.0

ADMINSTRATION

    o	Changed the LICENSE from Artistic 2.0 to Apache 2.0.

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 3.0.2

BUG FIXES

    o	Made compatible with new R check steps that verify DESCRIPTION
        and NAMESPACE dependencies.

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 3.0.1

NEW FEATURES

    o	Moved generic functions from PreProcess to oompaBase,
    	mainly to simplify the overall dependence structure 
	by taking unused PreProcess code out of the main line.

    o   Moved ColorCoding and ColorCodedPair classes from this package
    	into the oompaBase package.

BREAKING CHANGES

    o	Also moved semantic color names from PreProcess to oompaBase,
        and restructured it to add fewer entries into the namespace.
        Instead of using 'COLOR.EXPECTED', you must now refer to
        'oompaColors$EXPECTED'.
