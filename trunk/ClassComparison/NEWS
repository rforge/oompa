BUG FIXES

    o	Changed 'matrixMean', 'matrixVar', 'matrixT', and 'MultiTtest'
        to allow them to give sensible results in the face of  missing
        data.  Each function now has an additional argument, 'na.rm'
        which defaults to 'FALSE' for the matrix functions and to
        'TRUE' for the 'MultiTtest' function.

    o   Changed the names of matrix functions for t-test variants to
        conform to capitalization conventions. Specifically, changed
        from 'matrixpairedT' to 'matrixPairedT' and from
        'matrixunequalT' to 'matrixUnequalT'.
