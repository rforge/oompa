                CHANGES IN R VERSION 3.0.0


OLD FEATURES

    o   Moved several generic functions (that promoted S3 generics)
    	from this package into the oompaBase package.  Since
    	PreProcess still depends on oompaBase, no functionality should
    	change.

    o   Moved ColorCoding and ColorCodedPair classes from this package
    	into the oompaBase package.  Since PreProcess still depends on
    	oompaBase, no functionality should change.

BREAKING CHANGES

    o	Also moved semantic color names from PreProcess to oompaBase,
        and restructured it to add fewer entries into the namespace.
        Instead of using 'COLOR.EXPECTED', you must now refer to
        'oompaColors$EXPECTED'.
