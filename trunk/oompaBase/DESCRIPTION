Description: This package defines the class unions that must be
 preloaded in order for the basic tools in the OOMPA (object-oriented 
 microarray and proteomics analysis) project to be defined and loaded.
 It also includes vectorized operations for row-by-row means,
 variances, and t-tests. Finally, it provides new color schemes.
