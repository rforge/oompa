Author: Kevin R. Coombes
Maintainer: Kevin R. Coombes <kcoombes@mdanderson.org>
Depends: R (>= 3.0), methods
Description: This package defines the class unions that must be
  preloaded in order for the basic tools in the OOMPA (object-oriented

  It also includes vectorized operations for row-by-row means,
  variances, and t-tests. Finally, it provides new color schemes.
