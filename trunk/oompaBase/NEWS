		CHANGES IN R VERSION 3.0.1

NEW FEATURES

    o	Moved generic functions from PreProcess to oompaBase,
    	mainly to simplify the overall dependence structure 
	by taking unused PreProcess code out of the main line.

    o   Moved ColorCoding and ColorCodedPair classes from this package
    	into the oompaBase package.

BREAKING CHANGES

    o	Also moved semantic color names from PreProcess to oompaBase,
        and restructured it to add fewer entries into the namespace.
        Instead of using 'COLOR.EXPECTED', you must now refer to
        'oompaColors$EXPECTED'.
